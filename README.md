Bugs: 
The fps only goes up in a half or whole ratio (ex 2 and 4, not 1,2,3,4) 
Pressed save game and then refreshed and everything saved except for how much cat food i had bought the amount the money it costs stayed the same so its expensive but is at a 2x multiplier visually idk about actually
 
Ideas: 
New Game button (nice) (What button?)
